## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution

Develop a Smart Agro-FoodTech Platform that integrates precision agriculture, post-harvest management, and digital rural services to improve farmer productivity, reduce post-harvest losses, and ensure better access to markets. The solution leverages IoT-based smart farming, low-cost food preservation techniques, AI-driven crop advisory, and rural digital entrepreneurship hubs.

Key features:

IoT-enabled soil, water, and climate monitoring for precision farming.

Low-cost, solar-powered cold storage units to reduce food spoilage.

AI/ML-powered crop advisory and pest/disease prediction through a mobile app.

Blockchain-based digital marketplace to connect farmers directly with buyers.

Rural community centers (AgriTech Hubs) for training, knowledge-sharing, and digital access.

## Technical Approach
IoT & Sensor Networks: Soil moisture sensors, pH sensors, and weather stations for real-time monitoring; data transmitted via low-power LoRaWAN or 5G networks.

AI & Data Analytics: Machine learning models for predicting yield, detecting crop diseases from leaf images, and suggesting fertilizer/pesticide schedules.

FoodTech Innovations: Deployment of solar dryers, vacuum packaging, and bio-based preservatives for increasing shelf life of perishable goods.

Blockchain & FinTech: Secure digital ledger for transparent transactions; micro-credit and crop insurance via digital payments.

Digital Literacy & Rural Tech Hubs: Localized apps in regional languages, training programs, and integration with government schemes (PM-KISAN, e-NAM, etc.).
## Feasibility and Viability

Technical Feasibility: IoT sensors, solar dryers, and blockchain solutions are already commercially available and can be adapted for rural deployment. Mobile penetration in India’s rural areas is above 67%, making app-based advisory viable.

Economic Viability: Initial investment can be supported through government subsidies, CSR initiatives, and public-private partnerships. Solar-powered storage reduces energy costs. Direct-to-consumer sales increase farmer income by 20–30%.

Scalability: The model can start as a pilot in select districts and scale nationwide, leveraging existing FPOs (Farmer Producer Organizations).

Sustainability: Uses renewable energy, reduces wastage, and promotes rural employment, aligning with SDG-2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG-8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth).
## Impact and Benefits

For Farmers: Increased crop yield (10–15%), reduced post-harvest losses (up to 40%), higher income through fair pricing.

For Rural Communities: Job creation in food processing, storage, and logistics; empowerment of women and youth through digital literacy.

For Consumers: Safer, fresher, traceable food with reduced cost margins.

For Environment: Efficient water and fertilizer usage, reduced greenhouse gas emissions through optimized supply chains.

Long-Term Benefits: Strengthened rural economy, reduced urban migration, and enhanced food security at national and global levels.
